# Remembrall App

## Description

Remembrall is a task and project management application built with pure JavaScript. It's designed for efficient tracking and collaboration of projects and their associated tasks. This application was developed as part of the JavaScript path at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: The core of the project, with no additional frameworks.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler tool used to compile and bundle assets.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript transpiler that allows writing modern JS code and converting it to be browser-compatible.
- **Stylus**: A CSS preprocessor that facilitates efficient and feature-rich style writing.
- **Font Awesome**: An icon library.

## Paradigms and Patterns

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project leverages classes and objects to represent entities like projects and tasks. Concepts like encapsulation and abstraction are employed.
- **Modularity**: Code is structured in modules, especially with components and classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Possible Improvements

1. **Data Persistence**: Currently, data is stored in `localStorage`. An enhancement could be utilizing a real database like Firebase or MongoDB for long-term data persistence and multi-user collaboration.
2. **User Interface**: While the UI is functional, it can be enhanced in terms of design and user experience.
3. **Testing**: Incorporate unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a login system so users can have their individual task and project lists.
